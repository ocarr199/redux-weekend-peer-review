# Weekend Challenge 11 - React-Redux Feedback Form

## Instructions

Reviewing code is an important role developers play. We're going to practice reviewing code from others.

- Get the repo url from your partner
- Get your partner's project running on your computer
- Review the code from your partner and give relevant feedback
- Complete the Markdown section and submit that in the notes section on the assignment app. (Make sure you include who's code you reviewed.)

Practicing compassionate code reviews is important (you can learn more from this video on the topic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8EiIPZvh0 )

### Notes:

Your code is formatted very well and I am definitely going to take inspiration from how well you comment and format. Also you had over eighty commits! Wow! That is awesome and I am going to prioritize doing more commits because that is a great idea. I love the functionality of your app and how it feels to use it. The back and next buttons are great and the alerts look great. Your overall use of material UI looks really well. I also appreciate your descriptions of what each rating means. The progress bar is also a really nice touch. You were only missing the flag functionality on the admin page.

I can tell that you know what you are doing and you are doing a lot of fundamentals really well. Your formatting, readMe and comments are all really well done and make your code very easy to understand. Overall your project looks fantastic and I would have loved to see what you could have done with it if you had another day. Great job.
